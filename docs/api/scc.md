__Response__

Status: `200 OK`
```json
{"message": "User is synced successfully"}
```

__NOTE__:

- If user is found with discrepancies, then the error is returned.
- The error message mentions the values for various fields in both SCC and BWB systems.
- SCC system can use this message to find out which fields are mismatched, as BWB system is supposed to return all these fields even if only one field is mismatched as per [BEA-188](https://linear.app/beacon-health/issue/BEA-188/[10258]-return-values-even-for-those-that-match).
- BWB will return discrepancy values for the following fields in all uppercase. This is a short-term fix until SCC doesn't handle comparing these discrepancy values on their side.
  - First name
  - Last name
  - Address1
  - Address2
  - City

## Force sync user

```
PUT /api/users/:bwb_user_id/force-sync (authorization required)
```

__NOTE__:

- All fields are optional to be present in the API request body.
- This API does basic validations on the data before force updating the resource with whatever is coming from SCC because it is the source of truth.
- `bwb_user_id` passed in the URL is BWB's user id, and not the Connects member id or MDLive user id.
- This API doesn't perform any user search based on the data provided in the body. Instead, it simply updates the user whose `bwb_user_id` is passed in the URL.
- Fields `parentCode`, `groupNumber`, `benefitPackage`, can't be updated in this API. These fields will be ignored if send in the request body.
- Fields `firstName`, `lastName`, `addresLine2` are allowed _blank_ only for the purpose of searching the user in API [POST /api/users/sync](#sync-user). However, blanks are not allowed to save in the BWB system for these fields.
- Fields `firstName`, `lastName`, `dateOfBirth`, and `gender` can't be updated on BWB using these APIs. These fields will be ignored if sent to update.
