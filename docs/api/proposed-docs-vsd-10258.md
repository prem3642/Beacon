## Update user

```
PATCH /api/users/:bwb_user_id/force-sync (authorization required)
```

__NOTE__:
- This API doesn't perform any validations on the data and force updates the resource with whatever is coming from SCC because it is the source of truth.
- `bwb_user_id` passed in the URL is BWB's user id, and not the Connects member id or MDLive user id.
